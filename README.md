# CS-370---AI-Tresure-Hunt
For this project, I was given the environment code, maze layout, neural network model, and experience replay class. These pieces controlled the rules of the game, how the maze worked, and how the agent viewed its surroundings. My main task was to complete the Q-training loop that teaches the pirate agent through reinforcement learning. 
I wrote the code that runs each training round, chooses actions by balancing exploration and exploitation, records experiences, updates the neural network based on rewards, and checks whether the agent won or lost. The code I created is what allows the pirate to learn from its mistakes and slowly improve its path to the treasure over many training episodes.

Throughout this course, I learned how computer scientists solve problems by breaking them down, building algorithms, and testing different solutions. This project helped me understand how artificial intelligence connects to the larger field of computer science, because it showed how a program can learn to make decisions on its own. Computer scientists create 
technology that influences people, organizations, and society, so the work matters in real and meaningful ways. When I approach a problem, I now think about the goal, plan out the steps, and improve the solution through testing and adjustment. I also learned that computer scientists have ethical responsibilities, such as protecting users, handling data carefully, 
and avoiding designs that could cause harm. As systems become more advanced, especially with AI, it is important to build software that is fair, trustworthy, and responsible for both the end user and the organization.
